	i think the request is going out of scope/being killed and aborting because of it
see this "background mode" example:  =============================================
	import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular';
import { BackgroundMode } from '@ionic-native/background-mode';
import { NativeAudio } from '@ionic-native/native-audio';

export class HomePage {

  constructor(public navCtrl: NavController,public nativeAudio: NativeAudio , public backgroundMode : BackgroundMode) {

  }
}  
Next you need to preload the mp3 to be played before playing it:

this.nativeAudio.preloadSimple('audio1', 'audio/1.mp3').then((msg)=>{
  console.log("message: " + msg);
}, (error)=>{
  console.log("error: " + error);
});
Then you can add the method to play the audio

  public playAudio(){
    this.backgroundMode.enable();
    this.backgroundMode.on("activate").subscribe(()=>{
      this.nativeAudio.play("audio1");  
    });
    this.nativeAudio.play("audio1"),() => console.log('audio1 is done playing'));
  }
