  <h1>A Word about Care Planning</h1>
  <p>For home health providers in the US, this excerpt is from 42 CFR 484:</p>
  <p>§484.60(a) Standard: Plan of care.
    §484.60(a)(1) Each patient must receive the home health services that are
    written in an individualized plan of care that identifies patient-specific
    measurable outcomes and goals, and which is established, periodically
    reviewed, and signed by a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatry acting
    within the scope of his or her state license, certification, or
    registration. If a physician refers a patient under a plan of care that
    cannot be completed until after an evaluation visit, the physician is
    consulted to approve additions or modifications to the original plan.</p>
  <h1>How to use Red Book Care Planning</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose content from Tina Marrelli's Red Book</li>
    <li>Care plans are stored securely in the cloud</li>
    <li>Plan on multiple devices</li>
    <li>Care planning you do while offline is synchronized the next time you connect</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Red Book library is your assurance of high quality content that is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evidence-based</li>
    <li>US Regulatory Compliant</li>
    <li>Pragmatic, tuned by real-world experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The library includes starter templates, baseline plans you can incorporate into your own templates, and tailor to
    your patients. These are deliberately extensive to provide alternatives that fit your practice, and to remind of
    things that may be important to your patient. Select the template by condition; it is quick and easy to remove any
    content not applicable to your situation. Then customize.</p>
  <p>Access to the library for writing plans, and access to cloud storage for synching your devices is only available,
    of course, when you are connected to the internet. Care planning you do offline will be sync'd when you connect
    again.</p>
  <p>You use your subscription to select the <span class='hilite'>Add ... from the Red Book</span> buttons from various
    pages in the app. These include:</p>
  <ul class='hilite'>
    <li>Add a Standard Plan from the Red Book</li>
    <li>Add a Condition from the Red Book</li>
    <li>Add a Discipline from the Red Book</li>
    <li>Add a Care Topic from the Red Book</li>
    <li>Add an Outcome from the Red Book</li>
    <li>Add an Intervention from the Red Book</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each button presents a list of the corresponding items from the Red Book, for your incorporation into your
    customized care plans.</p>
  <h3>How Subscribing Works</h3>
  <p>The subscription is an In-App Purchase.</p>
  <p>When you tap Subscribe, the app will show you the subscription option(s) for your selection. If you choose <span
      class='hilite'>Purchase</span>, the subscription purchase is completed through Apple's standard iOS iTunes account
    purchase process. Payment for the subscription will be charged to your iTunes account, once you've confirmed.</p>
  <p>When this version of the app was released, the subscription was offered monthly. The period or length of the
    subscription may change from time to time. However, you will keep the subscription terms you originally signed up
    for, unless you change it yourself.</p>
  <p>The subscription renews automatically for another period, if you don't cancel it. Your iTunes account will be
    charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period. The charge for the renewal will be the same as
    the initial charge, but sometimes special promotions may be in effect.</p>
  <p>When this version of the app was released, the cost was 5.99 USD per month, or the equivalent in your local
    currency. Renewals will always be the price you originally signed up for, unless you specifically agree to a change,
    even if the price may be increased for new subscribers.</p>
  <p>If you've taken advantage of a free trial period, then when you subscribe the remaining portion, if any, of your
    free trial period is forfeit, and your subscription begins immediately</p>

  <button ion-button (click)='subscribe()' *ngIf='!auth.userLoggedIn'>Subscribe Now</button>
  <p *ngIf='auth.userLoggedIn' class='hilite'>You're already subscribed and logged in, so you're good to go.</p>
  <h2 id='without'>Without a Subscription</h2>
  <p>You can use Care Planning without a subscription to the Red Book library. Simply select WORK OFFLINE from the
    welcome page. You can still enjoy the thoughtful structure and ease of use, you'll just be providing your own
    content. Even with your own content, creating templates, copying and customizing plans, and using the text or pdf
    output in your documentation (or documentation system) will still save you countless hours, simplify your planning,
    and improve the quality of your documentation.
  </p>

  <h1 id='templates'>Create Care Plans faster with templates</h1>
  <p>Templates provide a quick and easy way to include most-used content in your care plans, while enabling
    individual patient specificity. The following instructions assume you've subscribed to the Red Book content, but
    it works nearly the same to re-use your own content.</p>

  <p>To create templates, follow these steps.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span>. We suggest naming your plan something
      easy
      to find later, such as 'CHF Template'. You may want to name all your templates so that they appear in the same
      section of Care Plans, such as 'Template <em>(condition)</em>.' You may also add a description.</li>
    <li><span class='hilite'>Add a Standard Care Plan from the Red Book</span> Available for many common diseases or
      conditions, these standard care plans include suggested topics, outcomes, and interventions, which will be added
      for
      you. Standard Plans generally include all nursing interventions.
    </li>
    <li>Preview the standard plan. Select All or individually select the outcomes and interventions you prefer. Scroll
      to the bottom of the screen to <span class='hilite'>SAVE</span>.
    </li>
    <li>Once added, the newly-created plan will appear at the end of your My Care Plans list. Tap to open.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To refine your template, you may extend the initial plan</p>
  <ul>Using the upper left menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> :
    <li>Add an additional condition, if needed. Use this option to create co-morbid or combined templates. You can
      choose <span class='hilite'>Add A Condition</span> to incorporate another Red Book Standard Care Plan.
      You can also add in one of your own plans, if you've already created one. Choose 'Add from My Plans.' </li>
    <li>Add a discipline, if needed. If you add a discipline, you have to option to Select All or individually choose
      outcomes and interventions.</li>
    <li>Add a care topic to the plan if needed. Care topics may be problems, disciplines, or simply care
      focus areas. You can select from the Red Book, or define your own.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>Using the menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> to the right of each Care Topic:
    <li>Add or edit outcomes associated with the topic. If you've selected a condition or discipline from
      the Red Book, you would have selected outcomes and interventions in the preview. You may edit or remove
      these as needed. Of course you may also create your own outcome statements, or add others from the Red Book
      library.
      Leave the blanks provided for specifics (because this will be a template.) Add blanks of your own, as needed.
    </li>
    <li>Add or edit interventions associated with the care topic. Interventions may also have been selected from
      the Red Book. Again, you may select other interventions from Red Book or create your own. Or remove or edit
      any as you see fit. Leave the blanks here too.
    </li>
    <li>When your changes are complete and the template plan is satisfactory, you're all done. No need to save
      explicitly, the app will save at intervals as you work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To begin planning for an individual patient, copy a template first.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From My Care Plans, choose <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW CARE PLAN</span>.</li>
    <li>On the Add a Care Plan Page, name the new plan. The name can be anything you like, but we suggest using care to
      observe patient privacy concerns. [See the <span class='hilite'>Patient Privacy Note</span>.]</li>
    <li>Note the 'Add' and 'Copy' buttons will be disabled if the new name duplicates an old name. The buttons become
      available immediately, as you type, if the new name hasn't already been used.</li>
    <li>Choose <span class='hilite'>Copy One of My Plans.</span></li>
    <li> Select the Template you want to use for your patient. As with conditions and disciplines, you will have the
      opportunity to preview and select the contents you want before saving.</li>
    <li>You will be returned to the My Care Plans page. You'll need to find the new one
      you just created before proceeding (it will be at the bottom of your list of plans).</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Open the new plan (tap on it's name to open its contents), then add or remove topics, outcomes, or interventions
    to meet your individual patient's needs. Fill in the blanks to provide necessary specifics.</p>
  <p>We also suggest you add all your co-morbid conditions for a patient at the same time, because the app will remove
    any duplication as you merge in additional conditions or disciplines. You're then able to refine your resulting
    template or plan thereafter.</p>
  <p>To merge in a co-morbid condition, you have two options. You can merge in additional conditions from the Red Book,
    or you can merge in one of your own care plans. If using your own, typically you would choose a discipline or
    condition template you've created.</p>
  <p>To merge in another condition from the Red Book:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the new plan if it's not already open.</li>
    <li>Tap the menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> icon </li>
    <li>Choose <span class='hilite'>Add a Condition.</span> As before, you'll be able to preview and select topics,
      outcomes, and interventions to be added.</li>
    <li>Proceed with adding, removing or modifying topics, outcomes, or interventions as needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To merge in one of your own Plans:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the new plan if it's not alreaedy open.</li>
    <li>Tap the menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> icon </li>
    <li>Choose Add from My Plan</li>
    <li>Select the desired plan from the Select list.</li>
    <li>Choose your preferred contents from the preview. <span class='hilite'>SAVE</span> when ready.</li>
    <li>Proceed with adding, removing or modifying topics, outcomes, or interventions as needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Merging Notes: topics, outcomes, and interventions that are not in the plan are added. Those that are
    already in the plan will not be added again.</p>
  <p>The merge compares topics, outcomes, and interventions exactly, letter for letter. If you've filled in some blanks
    in an item, that
    item will no longer match a like item exactly, and therefore will present again. This is a good reason to do all
    your merging first, and do your individualizing care after.</p>
  <p>When merging in a second condition or additional disciplines, the app will expand the care topic
    (in the Care Plan page) into which items were merged, as a way of showing you where content was added.</p>
  <p>Consider making multiple templates to apply to the most common conditions you encounter in your practice.</p>
  <p>You may also choose to make co-morbid or multi-condition templates. To do so, simply add the set of topics,
    outcomes, and interventions that apply to those conditions. For example, you may have a Diabetes-Hypertension
    Template, or a Cancer-Opiod Management Template.</p>

  <h1 id='privacy'>Patient Privacy Note</h1>
  <p>As health care professionals, we expect to maintain utmost confidentiality in treating patients' private
    information. In most countries, laws protect patient privacy, and many provide for severe penalties for violating
    this
    trust. Red Book Care Planning strongly recommends you do not identify care plans with individual patient names, or
    any
    other protected health information. We suggest using a mnemonic of some kind instead. As the basic idea behind the
    app is to
    enable you to compose plans to be easily inserted into some other documentation or documentation system, we suggest
    you
    identify the plan to the specific patient only in the context of a separate, secure system. While care plans stored
    in
    the cloud are encrypted and secure, we nonetheless feel minimizing exposure is the best approach.</p>
  <h1 id='quick'>Quick Guide</h1>


  <h1 id='more'>On Every Page</h1>
  <p>A heading at the top of the page tells you which page you’re on. </p>
  <p>Back option: Most pages will have a Back option, an arrow pointing to the left, at the left side of the
    heading. Use this to return to the previous page. On pages where you're adding or editing, 'back' will work just
    like
    'cancel'.</p>
  <p>LogIn: Most pages will have an unlock
    <ion-icon name='unlock'></ion-icon> icon with which you can log in to your Red Book subscription.
    If you're currently logged in, the icon will be a lock
    <ion-icon name='lock'></ion-icon> instead, which you can use to log out (which you rarely need to do).
  </p>
  <p>Help: Most pages will have a help, '?'
    <ion-icon name='help'></ion-icon> icon with which you can reach this help page. Of course you already knew that,
    or you wouldn’t be here.
  </p>

  <h1>The Welcome Page</h1>
  <p>This is the page you see first when the app starts. Depending on how you last used Care Plans, you will
    see different options, described below.</p>
  <h2 id='start'>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>If this is your very first time using the app, you will use <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> to get
    started. Once you've entered the app, you'll be able to subscribe to Red Book content with an In-App Purchase.</p>
  <p>On your first visit, your <span class='hilite'>My Care Plans</span> page will be empty, nearly blank. This is
    normal; this is the page where all your plans are listed, and of course you don't have any yet! You'll start with
    the
    big red <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span> button. See how to create a plan below.</p>
  <h2>If you've been here before</h2>
  <p><span class='hilite'>LOGIN</span> or <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> to enter the app. Log in to
    enable access to the Red Book care plan content. Work Offline to work only with your own content. You may also see
    <span class='hilite'>WELCOME BACK</span> if you were logged in when you left last time.</p>

  <p>If you were signed in when you last used the app, you may see <span class='hilite'>WELCOME BACK, YOU'RE
      LOGGED IN</span>, and a <span class='hilite'>CONTINUE</span> option.
    Tap to continue. </p>
  <p>If you were off line when you last used the app, and you have an active internet connection you'll have
    the option to <span class='hilite'>LOGIN</span> to sign into your Red Book Care Plans library subscription.</p>
  <p>If you were off line when last used, you are off line now, or you have never subscribed, or if you simply
    prefer to, you may also select <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> to continue without using the library.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to subscribe, choose the <span class='hilite'>LOGIN</span> option. You'll have an
    opportunity to subscribe from the login page. Or just tap this:</p>
  <button ion-button (click)='subscribe()'>Subscribe Now</button>
  <br>
  <h2>The Login Page</h2>
  <p>Reach this page from <span class='hilite'>LOGIN</span> on the Welcome page, or from the menu. You may want
    to sign in from the menu if you've been offline.</p>
  <p>No surprises, enter your user ID and password, select <span class='hilite'>LOGIN</span>. Log In will only
    be available if you're connected to the internet. If you're not already subscribed, or if your subscription has
    expired,
    you will have the option to <span class='hilite'>SUBSCRIBE</span>.
    You may select <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> to continue without signing in.
  </p>

  <h2>My Care Plans Page</h2>
  <p>This is your home page. You got here because you</p>
  <ul>
    <li>were <span class='hilite'>WELCOMED BACK</span>, or</li>
    <li>successfully signed in on the Login page, or</li>
    <li>selected <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> on the Welcome page, or</li>
    <li>selected <span class='hilite'>WORK OFFLINE</span> on the Login page.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On this page, all your care plans are listed. You will normally start out with an empty list, before
    you create your first plan. Listed plans may be templates you've created to be copied (see above,) or plans you've
    written for individual patients (see <a href='#privacy'>Patient Privacy</a> note and <span (click)='terms()'>terms
      and conditions</span>.)</p>
  <p>There's a big red <span class='hilite'>CREATE A NEW PLAN</span> button at the top of the page. Select
    that button to create a new plan, whether you intend to make a template or an individual patient's plan.</p>
  <p>Each plan listed on the page is identified by the name you gave when you created it. Following the
    name, there
    is an
    icon
    <ion-icon name='create' class='tool'></ion-icon>. Tap anywhere on the name or
    <ion-icon name='create' class='tool'></ion-icon>, to work with the Care Plan, including changing its
    name,
    copying it,
    deleting it, adding or changing contents, or sharing the plan.
  </p>
  <p>At the right of the title bar, you may also see upload <ion-icon name='cloud-upload' class='hilite'></ion-icon>
    and download
    <ion-icon name='cloud-download' class='hilite'></ion-icon> icons. These will appear if you are logged in.
    These are to force an upload of your device's current version of your care plans, or to force a
    download of the current cloud version. Usually, these are not needed, as the app takes care of syncing to the cloud
    as you use it.</p>
  <p>However, sometimes it's helpful for you to control exactly when the sync is done. For example, these may be used to
    quickly move your plans if you've made changes in one device and need it on
    another, that is, you may upload from the device with the changes, and download to the device that needs them. You
    may also
    need to download if someone else has signed into their Red Book subscription on the device you're using,
    and you need to restore your own plans to the device from the cloud.</p>
  <p>Note all the plans you have created are downloaded or uploaded together, so you don't want to have the
    latest of one plan on one device, and the latest of another plan on a different device.
  </p>

  <h2>(specific) Care Plan Page</h2>
  <p>Where all the work happens. The plan you selected on Care Plans Page is shown. The name of the plan
    appears at the top. To the left of the plan name is a menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> icon.</p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon class='hilite' name='book'></ion-icon>Add a Condition, only if you are logged in to your Red Book
    subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon class='hilite' name='book'></ion-icon>Add a Discipline, only if you are logged in to your Red Book
    subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='shuffle'></ion-icon> Add from My Plan, used to merge one of your other plans into this plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='add'></ion-icon>Add Care Topic
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='share'></ion-icon>Share, opens the Text Care Plan Page, from which you may clipboard, email, or make
    a PDF of your plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon>Delete, after confirmation, will remove the care plan permanently.
  </p>
  <p>Below the name, care topics are listed in Red. These topics may be aspects of care, physiology, disciplines,
    or otherfocus areas. This area will be blank initially, as you are creating a new plan. Each care topic has an
    option on the left
    to expand <ion-icon name='arrow-dropright'></ion-icon> or collapse <ion-icon name='arrow-dropdown'></ion-icon> its
    content, to enable easier navigation. The topics are
    listed in the order they were added to the plan.
  </p>
  <p>On the right of each Topic is a menu <ion-icon name='menu'></ion-icon> option to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='star'></ion-icon> Add an Outcome
    </li>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='construct'></ion-icon> Add an Intervention
    </li>
    <li>
      <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon> Delete this Topic
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When expanded, outcomes and interventions related to the care topic are listed. Outcomes are listed
    first in Green, followed by interventions in Blue.
  </p>
  <p>Both outcomes and interventions are listed in the order originally entered. You can drag and drop to
    rearrange outcomes or interventions within their topics, and within that screen view. (That is, the screen won't
    scroll while dragging.)
  </p>
  <p>Outcomes may indicate short or long term with “ST” or “LT” preceding the outcome text. Interventions may indicate
    the applicable discipline(s),
    listed after the intervention text.
  </p>
  <p>Each has a Delete <ion-icon name='trash'></ion-icon> option to the right of the item.
  </p>

<!-- §484.60(a) Standard: Plan of care.
§484.60(a)(1) Each patient must receive the home health services that are
written in an individualized plan of care that identifies patient-specific
measurable outcomes and goals, and which is established, periodically
reviewed, and signed by a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatry acting
within the scope of his or her state license, certification, or
registration. If a physician refers a patient under a plan of care that
cannot be completed until after an evaluation visit, the physician is
consulted to approve additions or modifications to the original plan.
